# Software Foundations

The Software Foundations series is a broad introduction to the mathematical underpinnings of reliable software.

The principal novelty of the series is that every detail is one hundred percent formalized and machine-checked:
the entire text of each volume, including the exercises, is literally a "proof script" for the Coq proof assistant.

The [linked repository](https://github.com/Kangji/SF2023S) contains the code covered by @Kangji in SNU Software Foundations 2023 Spring.
